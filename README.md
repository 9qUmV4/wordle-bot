# Wordle bot

This is a small script which aimes to half automate the game wordle.
We hacked it toghether in the lunch break, so don't expect anything. 

To get started run:
```
python3 wordle-bot.py --help
```
  
The english word list we used is [this](https://www-personal.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist.html) and the german wordlist [this](https://gist.github.com/MarvinJWendt/2f4f4154b8ae218600eb091a5706b5f4)
